# simulated-annealing
Given $N$ points on the plane (cities), the *travelling salesman problem* (TSP) is to find a route that travels though each city exactly once and ends up in the starting point. We attempt to solve this famous NP-hard problem with the simulated annealing and tempering method.

## Set up
